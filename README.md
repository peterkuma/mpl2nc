# mpl2nc

Convert Sigma Space Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) data files and afterpulse, overlap
and dead time correction files to NetCDF.

mpl2nc is a Python program for converting binary MPL files to NetCDF4. The
converted variables closely follow those in the binary files. See the *Micro
Pulse LiDAR System Software Manual* for description of the original format and
variables. In contrast to the official SigmaMPL software, mpl2nc preserves the
native resolution of the data and allows easier batch operation on many input
files. The program can run on any operating system with Python 2.7 or Python 3
and the netCDF4 Python package installed. Raw lidar backscatter is stored in
the `channel_1` (cross-polarized) and `channel_2` (co-polarized) variables.
Normalized relative backscatter (NRB) is calculated from the raw backscatter
(experimental). If afterpulse, overlap and dead time correction files are
supplied, the corrections are applied when calculating NRB.

Note that the vendor-supplied dead time correction is known to be incorrect
in some instances. The dead time bin files use 32-bit floating point values
to store polynomial coefficients, which may be truncated due to the limited
precision of the data type. Using such dead time correction with mpl2nc or
the SigmaMPL software will result in wrong calibration.

## Usage

mpl2nc is supposed to be run from the command line. Linux is recommended,
but it may be possible to run mpl2nc under
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
on other operating systems.

Usage:

```sh
mpl2nc [-a <afterpulse>] [-d <dead_time>] [-h] [-o <overlap>] [-q] [-v] [<input>] <output>
```

Optional arguments:

- `-a <afterpulse>`: Afterpulse correction file (`.bin`).
- `-d <dead_time>`: Dead time correction file (`.bin`).
- `-h`: Show help message and exit.
- `-o <overlap>`: Overlap correction file (`.bin`).
- `-q`: Run quietly (suppress output).
- `-v`: Show program's version number and exit.

Positional arguments:

- `input`: Input `.mpl` file or a directory containing `.mpl` files.
- `output`: Output `.nc` file or a directory where the resulting `.nc` files are written.

If `input` is not specified, only the correction files are converted
and written to `output`.

Currently only afterpulse correction file version 3 (SigmaMPL2013R1.0 and later)
is supported.

See also the man page for information about usage:

```
man mpl2nc
```

## Examples

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin 201803040300.mpl 201803040300.nc
```

Convert `201803040300.mpl` to `201803040300.nc` using correction files for afterpulse, overlap and dead time.

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin in out
```

Convert MPL files in the directory `in` to NetCDF files in the directory `out` using correction files for afterpulse,  overlap  and  dead time.

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin calibration.nc
```

Convert afterpulse, overlap and dead time correction files to the NetCDF file `calibration.nc`.

## Installation

Install the required software:

- Python 2.7 or 3 (recommended [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) on Windows)
- numpy Python package
- netCDF4 Python package

numpy and netCDF4 can be installed with pip if available in your Python distribution:

```sh
pip install numpy netCDF4
```

To install mpl2nc with pip:

```sh
pip install mpl2nc
````

Optionally, to install from the source distribution:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

You can also run the script mpl2nc directly without installation.

## Additional information

### Range calculation

Range can be calculated as `0.5*bin_time*c*([0, ..., n - 1] + 0.5)`,
where `n` is the number of bins.

### NRB

mpl2nc uses the following formula to calculate NRB:

```python
nrb_copol = (channel_2*dtcf(channel_2) - background_average_2*dtcf(background_average_2) -
            ap_copol*dtcf(ap_copol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy +
            ap_background_average_copol*dtcf(ap_background_average_copol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy)*
            range**2/(ol_overlap*energy_monitor*1e-3)
nrb_crosspol = (channel_1*dtcf(channel_1) - background_average_1*dtcf(background_average_1) -
               ap_crosspol*dtcf(ap_crosspol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy +
               ap_background_average_crosspol*dtcf(ap_background_average_crosspol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy)*
               range**2/(ol_overlap*energy_monitor*1e-3)
```

where `range` is range in m and dtcf is a function which calculates the dead
time correction factor for given photon counts. The correction fields
are interpolated on the data range.
