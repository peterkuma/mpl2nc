# mpl2nc

Convert Sigma Space Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) data files and afterpulse, overlap
and dead time correction files to NetCDF.

mpl2nc is a Python program for converting binary MPL files to NetCDF4. The
converted variables closely follow those in the binary files. See the *Micro
Pulse LiDAR System Software Manual* for description of the original format and
variables.

Raw lidar backscatter is stored in the `channel_1` and `channel_2` variables.

**Experimental:** Normalized relative backscatter (NRB) is calculated from the
raw backscatter. If afterpulse, overlap and dead time correction files are
supplied, the corrections are applied when calculating NRB.

The program uses Python 2.7 and can run on any operating system with
Python 2.7 and the netCDF4 Python package installed.

**Note:** The current release is beta – feature-complete but not tested
comprehensively yet.

## Usage

```sh
mpl2nc [-a <afterpulse>] [-d <dead_time>] [-h] [-o <overlap>] [-q] [-v] [<input>] <output>
```

Optional arguments:

- `-a` – afterpulse correction file (bin)
- `-d` – dead time correction file (bin)
- `-h` – show help message and exit
- `-o` – overlap correction file (bin)
- `-q` – run quietly (suppress output)
- `-v` – show program's version number and exit

Positional arguments:

- `input` – input file or directory (mpl)
- `output` – output file or directory (NetCDF)

## Install

Install the required software:

- Python 2.7 (recommended Anaconda/Python 2.7 on Windows)
- numpy Python package
- netCDF4 Python package

numpy and netCDF4 can be installed with pip if available in your Python distribution:

```sh
pip install numpy netCDF4
```

To install mpl2nc with pip:

```sh
pip install mpl2nc
````

Optionally, to install from the source distribution:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

You can also run the script mpl2nc directly without installation.
