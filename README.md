# mpl2nc

Convert Sigma Space Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) data files and afterpulse, overlap
and dead time correction files to NetCDF.

mpl2nc is a Python program for converting binary MPL files to NetCDF4. The
converted variables closely follow those in the binary files. See the *Micro
Pulse LiDAR System Software Manual* for description of the original format and
variables. In contrast to the official SigmaMPL software, mpl2nc preserves the
native resolution of the data and allows easier batch operation on many input
files. The program can run on any operating system with Python 3. Raw lidar
backscatter is stored in the `channel_1` (cross-polarized) and `channel_2`
(co-polarized) variables.  Normalized relative backscatter (NRB) is calculated
from the raw backscatter (experimental). If afterpulse, overlap and dead time
correction files are supplied, the corrections are applied when calculating
NRB.

Note that the vendor-supplied dead time correction is known to be incorrect
in some instances. The dead time bin files use 32-bit floating point values
to store polynomial coefficients, which may be truncated due to the limited
precision of the data type. Using such dead time correction with mpl2nc or
the SigmaMPL software will result in wrong calibration. In such case please
use a CSV file with dead time correction polynomial curve values as specified in
the instrument's documentation ([see below](#dead-time-correction)).

## Usage

mpl2nc is a command line program to be run a terminal (Linux and macOS) or the
Command Prompt (Windows).

Synopsis:

`mpl2nc` [`-a` *afterpulse*] [`-d` *dead_time*] [`-o` *overlap*] [`-q`] [`-v`] [*input*] *output* \
`mpl2nc` `-h`|`--help`

Optional arguments:

- `-a` *afterpulse*: Afterpulse correction file (`.bin`).
- `-d` *dead_time*: Dead time correction file (`.bin` or `.csv`).
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-o` *overlap*: Overlap correction file (`.bin`).
- `-q`: Run quietly (suppress output).
- `-v`: Show program's version number and exit.

Positional arguments:

- *input*: Input `.mpl` file or a directory containing `.mpl` files.
- *output*: Output `.nc` file or a directory where the resulting `.nc` files are written.

If *input* is not specified, only the correction files are converted and
written to *output*.

Currently only afterpulse correction file version 3 (SigmaMPL2013R1.0 and
later) is supported.

The dead time correction file can come either from the vendor-supplied `.bin` file
or from a CSV file created manually from a polynomial curve specified in the
instrument's documentation ([see below](#dead-time-correction)).

On Linux and macOS, see also the man page for information about usage:

```
man mpl2nc
```

## Examples

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin 201803040300.mpl 201803040300.nc
```

Convert `201803040300.mpl` to `201803040300.nc` using correction files for afterpulse, overlap and dead time.

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin in out
```

Convert MPL files in the directory `in` to NetCDF files in the directory `out` using correction files for afterpulse,  overlap  and  dead time.

```sh
mpl2nc -a MMPL5054_Afterpulse_201903220500.bin -o MMPL5054_Overlap_201903270700.bin -d MMPL5054_SPCM34184_Deadtime7.bin calibration.nc
```

Convert afterpulse, overlap and dead time correction files to the NetCDF file `calibration.nc`.

## Installation

It is recommended to run mpl2nc on Linux.

### Linux

On Debian-derived distributions (Ubuntu, Devuan, ...), install the required
system packages with:

```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip pipx
```

On Fedora, install the required system packages with:

```sh
sudo yum install python3 pipx
```

Install mpl2nc:

```sh
pipx install mpl2nc
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1
ln -s ~/.local/pipx/venvs/mpl2nc/share/man/man1/mpl2nc.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/
```

Make sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is included in the `PATH` environment
variable if not already. This can be done with `pipx ensurepath`.

You should now be able to run `mpl2nc` and see the manual page with `man mpl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
pipx uninstall mpl2nc
rm ~/.local/share/man/man1/mpl2nc.1
```

### macOS

Open the Terminal. Install mpl2nc with:

```sh
python3 -m pip install mpl2nc
```

Make sure that `/Users/<user>/Library/Python/<version>/bin` is included in the
`PATH` environment variable if not already, where `<user>` is your system
user name and `<version>` is the Python version. This path should be printed
by the above command. This can be done by adding this line to the file
`.zprofile` in your home directory and restart the Terminal:

```sh
PATH="$PATH:/Users/<user>/Library/Python/<version>/bin"
```

You should now be able to run `mpl2nc` and see the manual page with `man mpl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
python3 -m pip uninstall mpl2nc
```

### Windows

Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org). In the installer, tick `Add
python.exe to PATH`.

Open Command Prompt from the Start menu. Install mpl2nc with:

```sh
pip install mpl2nc
```

You should now be able to run `mpl2nc`.

To uninstall:

```sh
pip uninstall mpl2nc
```

## Additional information

### Range calculation

Range can be calculated as `0.5*bin_time*c*([0, ..., n - 1] + 0.5)`,
where `n` is the number of bins.

### NRB

mpl2nc uses the following formula to calculate NRB:

```python
nrb_copol = (channel_2*dtcf(channel_2) - background_average_2*dtcf(background_average_2) -
            ap_copol*dtcf(ap_copol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy +
            ap_background_average_copol*dtcf(ap_background_average_copol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy)*
            range**2/(ol_overlap*energy_monitor*1e-3)
nrb_crosspol = (channel_1*dtcf(channel_1) - background_average_1*dtcf(background_average_1) -
               ap_crosspol*dtcf(ap_crosspol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy +
               ap_background_average_crosspol*dtcf(ap_background_average_crosspol)*energy_monitor*1e-3/ap_energy)*
               range**2/(ol_overlap*energy_monitor*1e-3)
```

where `range` is range in m and dtcf is a function which calculates the dead
time correction factor for given photon counts. The correction fields
are interpolated on the data range.

### Dead time correction

A CSV file with dead time correction values can be supplied with the `-d` option.
This can be created from a dead time correction polynomial curve table supplied
with the instrument. For example:

![](dt-example/dt.png)

The CSV file should contain two columns: `count` (in Kc/s) and `factor`
(unitless). The values should be as specified in the table for your particular
instrument. For the above example, the content of the
[CSV file](dt-example/dt.csv) should be:

```csv
count,factor
13.6,1.00
33.9,1.01
87.1,0.98
220.3,0.98
542.4,1.00
1332.2,1.02
2071.1,1.04
3101.2,1.10
4550.5,1.19
6630.3,1.29
9281.0,1.46
10855.9,1.58
12618.1,1.71
14570.7,1.86
16570.5,2.06
18778.5,2.29
20667.1,2.62
23145.1,2.94
25075.1,3.42
27049.1,3.99
28816.7,4.71
30462.6,5.61
31942.1,6.74
33147.1,8.18
33964.4,10.05
34434.4,12.47
```

The resulting curve is linearly interpolated between the specified points
in the `count`–*log*(`factor`) space. For count values below the smallest value,
a factor of 1 is used. For count values above the largest values, a factor
of infinity (in the floating-point data type) is used and a warning is issued.
